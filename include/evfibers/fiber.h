/** \mainpage About libevfibers
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * libevfibers is a small C fiber library that uses libev based event loop and
 * libcoro based coroutine context switching. As libcoro alone is barely enough
 * to do something useful, this project aims at building a complete fiber API
 * around it while leveraging libev's high performance and flexibility.
 *
 * You may ask why yet another fiber library, there are GNU Pth, State threads,
 * etc. When I was looking at their API, I found it being too restrictive: you
 * cannot use other event loop. For GNU Pth it's solely select based
 * implementation, as for state threads --- they provide several
 * implementations including poll, epoll, select though event loop is hidden
 * underneath the public API and is not usable directly. I found another
 * approach more sensible, namely: just put fiber layer on top of well-known
 * and robust event loop implementation. Marc Lehmann already provided all the
 * necessary to do the job: event loop library libev with coroutine library
 * libcoro.
 *
 * So what's so cool about fibers? Fibers are user-space threads. User-space
 * means that context switching from one fiber to an other fiber takes no
 * effort from the kernel. There are different ways to achieve this, but it's
 * not relevant here since libcoro already does all the dirty job. At top level
 * you have a set of functions that execute on private stacks that do not
 * intersect. Whenever such function is going to do some blocking operation,
 * i.e. socket read, it calls fiber library wrapper, that asks event loop to
 * transfer execution to this function whenever some data arrives, then it
 * yields execution to other fiber. From the function's point of view it runs
 * in exclusive mode and blocks on all operations, but really other such
 * functions execute while this one is waiting. Typically most of them are
 * waiting for something and event loop dispatches the events.
 *
 * This approach helps a lot. Imagine that you have some function that requires
 * 3 events. In classic asynchronous model you will have to arrange your
 * function in 3 callbacks and register them in the event loop. On the other
 * hand having one function waiting for 3 events in ``blocking'' fashion is
 * both more readable and maintainable.
 *
 * Then why use event loop when you have fancy callback-less fiber wrappers?
 * Sometimes you just need a function that will set a flag in some object when
 * a timer times out. Creating a fiber solely for this simple task is a bit
 * awkward.
 *
 * libevfibers allows you to use fiber style wrappers for blocking operations
 * as well as fall back to usual event loop style programming when you need it.
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * \subsection requirements_ssec Requirements
 *
 * To build this documentation properly you need to have
 * [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) version >= 1.8 since it used
 * markdown.
 *
 * To build libevfibers you need the following packages:
 * - [cmake](http://www.cmake.org)
 *
 *   CMake is a build system used to assemble this project.
 * - [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) development files
 *
 *   Well-known and robust event loop.
 * - [valgrind](http://valgrind.org) development files
 *
 *   libevfibers makes use of client requests in valgrind to register stacks.
 * - [Check](http://check.sourceforge.net) unit testing framework
 *
 *   Strictly it's not a requirement, but you better run unit tests before
 *   installation.
 *
 * You don't need libcoro installed as it's part of source tree and will build
 * along with libevfibers.
 *
 * As far as runtime dependencies concerned, the following is required:
 *  - [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) runtime files
 *
 * For debian-based distributions users (i.e. Ubuntu) you can use the following
 * command to install all the dependencies:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * sudo apt-get install cmake libev-dev valgrind check
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * \subsection building_ssec Building
 *
 * Once you have all required packages installed you may proceed with building.
 * Roughly it's done as follows:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * git clone https://code.google.com/p/libevfibers
 * cd libevfibers/
 * mkdir build
 * cd build/
 * cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
 * make
 * sudo make install
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * \subsection building_deb_ssec Building debian package
 * If you are running debian-based distribution, it will be more useful to
 * build a debian package and install it.
 *
 * The following actions will bring you there:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * git clone https://code.google.com/p/libevfibers
 * cd libevfibers/
 * dpkg-buildpackage
 * sudo dpkg -i ../libevfibers?_*_*.deb ../libevfibers-dev_*_*.deb
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * \section contributors_sec Contributors
 * libevfibers was written and designed by Konstantin Olkhovskiy.
 *
 * Sergey Myasnikov contributed some patches, a lot of criticism and ideas.
